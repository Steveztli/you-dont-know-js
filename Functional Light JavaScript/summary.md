# Functional Light JavaScript

## Chapter 1

### Default paramter

Null is considered to be a valid passed argument and then the fuction will not use the default parameter.
Undefined is considered same as no parameter given.

### Arity
The number of arguments a function expects is called 'arity'.

| Function | Arity | Also called |
|---|---|---|  
| foo(a) | One | Unary |
| foo(a,b) | Two | Binary |
| foo(a,b,c) | Three | Ternary |

A function signature that accepts an indeterminate amount of arguments is referred to as a 'variadic function'.
